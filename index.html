            <h3>Deloitte</h3>
            <p>Learned all about Human-Centered Design business approach and utilized the concept to develop a medium-fidelity prototype as a solution to my 6-people team assigned problem: How might we help employees to better separate their personal and professional lives; We also learned how to effectively pitch the idea to our managers! /*Watch the moment of truth <a href="https://youtu.be/vcEh-UKYB3I" target="_blank">HERE</a>!*/</p>

            <h3>KidoCode</h3>
            <p>Had the perfect chance to learn about the subtle yet very important relationship between the world of finance (specifically cryptocurrency) and the technology behind the scene. I had the exposure to a wide range of libraries from crypto-related ones such as Python-binance to data-analyzing's like Pandas. You can view most of the libraries I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18xjmiqgsDh69_8eUra0GQiLSEorWrWjR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">HERE</a>. At the end of the internship, I managed to build my own cryptocurrency!</p>

            <h3>Derryfield Robotic Team (12465)</h3>
            <p>Had a brief encountering with Java, a language that I have not used prior to joining the team. My main responsibility was to maintain the robot's mobility codes to move and a side job of being the driver (since I'm among the ones that know the code best!) in the competition, too! I also met Github for the first time and learned how to finish a code collaboratively on that platform.</p>

            <h3>ASSIST</h3>
            <p>Through a competitively selected poll (175 out of over 1000 students), I was chosen as one of three scholars to represent Vietnam in the USA on a 100% scholarship. It is not wrong to say that "Spending a year in life abroad is like living a whole new life in a year!" Another ASSIST student (she's from Germany) and I made a speech in front of the school to talk about our experiences per the principal's request.</p>
